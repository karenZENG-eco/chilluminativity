Scene 1 


Narrator - Tom
Angel Gabriel - Simon
Mary - Harry
Donkey - Sjin


Narrator:  A long time ago, in the town of Nazareth, lived a young woman named Mary. Mary did her chores, was kind to others, and loved God very much. She was engaged to be married to Joseph, who was a carpenter. We join our young couple


Angel Gabriel:  Mary you are favoured by God, and he is with you everywhere you go.


Mary: What the fuck do you want, mate? 


Angel Gabriel:  Please do not be afraid, my child.


Mary:  Why are you visiting me? I’m just a innocent, young girl with beautiful flowing hair.


Donkey: Hee haw!


Angel Gabriel:  God has sent me as he has found favour with you. You will have a baby boy, and are to give him the name Jesus Christ!


Mary: I'm confused. I'm a virgin. How can girl get pragnent?


Donkey:  Hee haw!


Angel Gabriel:  The Holy Spirit will perform a sexy miracle, and your baby will be called the Son of God, Our Lord and Saviour, His Holiness, Mr Jesus H Christ.


Mary:  How can I believe what you are saying, sweet angel?


Angel Gabriel:  Well, strap in because I have more exciting news. Even your dried up cousin Elizabeth is going to have a son in her old age.


Mary:  But she can't have any children.


Angel Gabriel:  Surprise motherfucker, she is already pregnant. Nothing is impossible with God. He’s like Derren Brown.


Donkey: Hee haw!


Mary:  I don't know what to say. Thank you! Oh praise the Lord, thank you, oh smooth-faced angel, you have changed my little virgin life.


Angel Gabriel:  It's ok Mary, calm down, you eager fuck.


Mary:  I am the VIRGIN Mary, Lord's servant, and I hope everything that you are saying will come true.


Narrator: And lo, did Mary then decide to get her sweet virgin ass to Bethlehem


O Little Town of Bethlehem 


O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
Away in a manger
No crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus
Lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky
Look down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus
Asleep on the hay
Asleep on the hay
O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

Scene 2


Angel Gabriel - Simon
Joseph - Tom
Mary - Harry
Donkey - Sjin


Angel Gabriel:  Joseph. 


Joseph: Oh fuck! It’s a floating white man!


Angel Gabriel: Calm, my child. Mary is going to have a baby.


Joseph:  I knew that bitch was sleeping around! How can anyone resist that beautiful, long hair?


Donkey: Hee haw!


Angel Gabriel:  Joseph don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, make this son legitimate.


Joseph:  Why should I take her as my wife? She is going to have a baby to another man. I’m no cuck.


Angel Gabriel:  No Joseph, Mary is going to have God's son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.


Joseph:  So, you’re saying God impregnated my virgin girlfriend?


Angel Gabriel: Yes


Donkey: Hee haw!


Joseph: Well, I’m convinced! I'll take her as my wife and love her till the end. What a joke.


(Angel then disappeared, and Joseph is left alone. Mary walks in.)


Mary:  Joseph, what is wrong?


Joseph:  I'm very happy you are going to have a baby, but he’s not my son.


Mary:  Isn't it wonderful? Im a virgin smiley face.


Donkey: Hee haw!


Joseph:  What? No, it’s not my son. Either way, we must go to Bethlehem, to register you as my virgin wife.


Mary:  Let’s do it! Let’s run away to Las Bethlehem and marry!


Joseph: Yes, let us ride upon this little donkey *camel.

________________






While Shepherds watch their Flock


While shepherds watched
Their flocks by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shone around




"Fear not," he said,
For mighty dread
Had seized their troubled minds
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind."


"To you in David's
Town this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior who is Christ the Lord
And this shall be the sign."


"All glory be to
God on high
And to the earth be peace;
Goodwill henceforth
From heaven to men
Begin and never cease
Begin and never cease!"

(The shepherds fell to their knees and were happy that they had found baby Jesus)


Shepherd 2:  This is the baby that the Angel was talking about. He looks quite angry though!


Joseph: Don’t worry friend, he’s quite H-ARMLESS. Please be quiet my friends, My wife needs to sleep.


Sheep:  We must tell everyone a-baaa-out the good news.


(As soon as they left they began shouting in the streets)


Sheep:  A one armed plastic baby has been born! He’s going to save us apparently! He’s called Jamesus or something! I wasn’t listening properly! I am a sheep.


Shepherd 2:  Yes. The son of this sexy virgin will be the one who will save us.


Joseph:  Now sleep, my virgin wife, as we have a big day ahead of us.


Mary:  (BARRY QUICKLY CHANGES COSTUME) I am a virgin and I need my sleep. But also I cannot sleep knowing just how important our baby is.

Wise man 1:  Hark! What is that peculiar light in the sky? 


Wise man 2:  Why it is a star, and doth it shines brightly!


Wise man 3:  Of course it's a fucking star my ‘wise’ friends. How long did it take you to figure that one out?


Wise man 2:  It's the star we have been looking for!


Wise man 1:  Yes, The star that will show us da wae? 


Wise men 1, 2, 3: (UNISON) ...the One who would save the world has been born.


(King Herod Enters)


King Herod:  What the fuck is this about a baby being borned?


Wise man 1:  Ahem, I'm sorry my King, but I don't know anything about it.


King Herod:  My wise men, knowledgeable in alchemy, the stars and futanari, do you not know where this baby has been borned?


Wise man 2:  We are sorry my Lord, but we do not know of this child you speak of.


Wise man 1:  Yes, we do not know where this special baby has been born.


Wise man 3:  In Bethlehem. I heard on the news that one day a special person would come from there and take care of all the people.


Wise man 2: What the fuck dude


King Herod:  Go and find this child.  As soon as you find him, tell me, so I can go and worship the shit out of him.


(WISE MEN WALKING)


Wise man 2:  How are we to find this baby? We don't know exactly where this baby is.


Wise Man 1: It’s impossible. There’s no logical way that we could find a random baby.


Wise man 3:  I know! At night we'll follow the star to the east.


Wise man 1: Where the fuck did you pull that idea from?


Wise man 2:  Yes, that's a great idea and soon we will find him.


Wise man 1: What? Seriously?


Wise man 3: Follow the star!


Wise man 1: Why are we called wise men? 


(Angels appeared to the Wise men)


Angel 1: (SJIN QUICKLY REMOVES HEROD OUTFIT PUTS ON HALO) Please find this baby, but don't tell the King. The King is a major arsehole. He wants to kill all the babbies. Take the baby very expensive gifts, gifts that you would give to a King. Not a jerk King but a good king.


Wise men 1, 2, 3:  We forsake our King and trust you angel who has only just appeared to us. We trust you a lot.


(ANGEL FUCKS OFF)


Wise man 2:  Look, we are here already.

Away in a manger 


Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay


The cattle are lowing, the poor Baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the night sky
And stay by my side till morning is nigh


Be near me, Lord Jesus; I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to Heaven to live with Thee there

Scene 8


Angel - Simon
Joseph - Tom
Mary - Harry
Donkey Narrator - Sjin


Angel: I know I said this earlier but I’m going to say it again. Remember never tell the King.  King Herod doesn't want to find Jesus to worship him; he wants to kill him because he is jealous that this baby will someday be better than him, and more handsome than him, and steal all the girls and attention.


(JOSEPH AND MARY ARE ASLEEP)


Angel:  Joseph... Joseph wake up!


Joseph:  Yes, what is wrong?


Angel: Take Jesus and Mary and run away to Egypt. King Herod is going to search for Jesus to kill him.


Joseph:  Mary wake up, We must leave now in the night.


Mary:  Why must we leave?


Joseph:  We must leave to travel to Egypt, as the King has sent someone to kill Jesus.


Donkey Narrator:  Joseph and Mary made their way to Egypt. The journey was fraught with danger and they had to overcome incredible obstacles. It’s an amazing story but we’re out of time so we’re just going to skip to the end. They got to Egypt, Herod died, they moved to Nazareth and that's where Jesus grew up. The End. Thanks bye.
